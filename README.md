# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification — Machine Learning Project

### 📘 Overview  
This project is a complete **end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline** built using **Python, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit**.  
It predicts the **species of an Iris flower** based on four key features — *Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length,* and *Petal Width.*

> 🚀 *An elegant ML + Streamlit project designed for learning, demonstration, and portfolio presentation.*

## 🧠 Objective
The goal of this project is to classify Iris flowers into one of the following species:
- **Setosa**
- **Versicolor**
- **Virginica**

This dataset is widely used for introducing classification concepts in Machine Learning due to its simplicity and interpretability.
